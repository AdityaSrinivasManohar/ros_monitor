# ROS_MONITOR
ros_monitor is inspired by [cyber_monitor](https://cyber-rt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is a tui which shows ros topics with their types as well as any messages on the topics. This way one wouldnt have to remember any of the ros cli commands, and have all information in one cli-tool.
